This repository contains three folders, each containing the code for the three case studies considered in the paper:
* ```cmaes```: Step Size Adaptation in CMA-ES
* ```fd```: Heuristic Selection in FastDownward
* ```sgd```: Learning Rate Control in Neural Network Training

To get started, clone the repository (```git clone git@github.com:automl/2021_JAIR_DAC_experiments.git```) and ```cd``` into the specific folder and see the respective ```README.md```'s for instructions on how to use this code.
